Add form

[Not tested] Remove delete option/ make dependant on nullable field

[no] Can use adjustable admin/form for inline instead?

auto-fill title?

Add/remove variations (only on our admin form)


== Create
Can create with null, but displaying bold text
Can't adjust inline fields by view
Incomplete info  
- constraint failed: image_image.width

== Delete raise exception. 
Raises on img
prob not an admin issue?
- I/O operation on closed file
- validation not working in that scenario

If img removed, can change title

Delete removes the review

== Fields
